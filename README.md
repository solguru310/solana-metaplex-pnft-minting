# Solana Programmable NFT Minting

## Overview

A 2022 battle for market share between NFT marketplaces nearly eliminated enforcement of creator royalties for Solana NFTs. In response, Metaplex has recently launched a new token standard, Programmable NFTs. The standard, among other things, empowers creators to enable royalties enforcement by specifying which programs can transfer their NFTs. In this guide, you will mint a Programmable NFT with metadata to Solana's devnet from your terminal using the Solana Web3 library and Metaplex JS SDKs.

## Programmable NFTs

Programmable NFTs are a new asset class that allows for flexible configuration of various lifecycle rules, including certain transfer restrictions that creators can use to enforce royalties. You will likely be impacted if you are a creator, protocol developer, or user of Solana NFTs.
